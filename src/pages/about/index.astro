                    <p>
                        Hello there, my name is Tamas Mezei! I work as a software engineer / architect in Zurich,
                        Switzerland.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From my early days tinkering with computers and programming languages to my years of
                        professional experience in the field, I have come to appreciate the power of software to
                        transform lives and businesses. As the web and cloud have become increasingly important and
                        ubiquitous, I have focused my attention on mastering these technologies and exploring their
                        potential to create scalable, secure, and user-friendly solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through this website, I hope to not only showcase my work and expertise but also contribute to
                        the wider software development community. I believe in the power of collaboration, open source,
                        and continuous learning, and I hope my <InternalLink href="/blog">blog posts</InternalLink> and
                        other content will inspire others in their own journeys.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm also a firm believer in making the internet a better place, that's why I've created a
                        website that's simple, clean, and free from all the annoying distractions that plague the
                        internet these days.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Being said that you won't find any ads, affiliate links, or spyware here, just pure
                        unadulterated content.
                    </p>

                        I hope you enjoy exploring my website, and if you have any questions or comments, feel free to

            <h2>About this website</h2>

            <p>
                I like to think of this website as my own little digital playground. The current version of the website
                is a minimum viable product (MVP) and represents an initial step towards my ultimate vision. I aim to
                maintain a minimalistic approach and only introduce new features or modifications when they are truly
                necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
                The website's source code is available on <ExternalLink
                    href="https://github.com/mezeitamas/brokenrobot.xyz"
                >
                    GitHub
                </ExternalLink>. Please don't hesitate to create an <ExternalLink
                    href="https://github.com/mezeitamas/brokenrobot.xyz/issues"
                >
                    issue
                </ExternalLink>
                 if you encounter a bug or typo, or if you have any suggestions to offer.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'll be documenting any improvements or modifications to the website through blog posts that will be
                published on this site:
            </p>

            <ul>
                {
                    posts.map((post) => (
                        <li>
                            <InternalLink href={`/blog/${post.slug}/`}>{post.data.title}</InternalLink>
                        </li>
                    ))
                }
            </ul>
