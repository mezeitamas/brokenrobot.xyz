  Keep the Verify group LAST and renumber it to follow your work groups (e.g. ## 5. Verify).
  Do not drop or water down its items — every UI change carries both-theme visual + a11y coverage.

## N. Verify

- [ ] Visual + a11y snapshots pass in **both themes** for every touched view (visual-regression-tests skill)
- [ ] `type:check`, `lint:check`, `format:check` all pass (preflight-checks skill)
- [ ] `build` succeeds — no third-party requests, no CSP violations
- [ ] Manual preview: no theme flash, interactions work, console clean, responsive at 375px
