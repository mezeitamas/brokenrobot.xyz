## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Site header

The site SHALL render a header containing a logo (mascot head + "BrokenRobot" wordmark + a monospace `brokenrobot.xyz` line), primary navigation, and the theme toggle. The header SHALL be responsive and SHALL not overflow on small screens.

#### Scenario: Header contents

- **WHEN** any page renders
- **THEN** the header shows the logo, the primary nav links, and the theme toggle control

#### Scenario: Responsive header

- **WHEN** the viewport is phone-width
- **THEN** the header layout adapts (condensing secondary elements) without horizontal overflow

#### Scenario: Active nav state

- **WHEN** a reader is on a section's page
- **THEN** the corresponding nav item is visibly marked active

### Requirement: Site footer

The site SHALL render a footer containing the mascot, a short brand blurb, link columns (writing/about and elsewhere/social + RSS), and a sign-off line. Links SHALL use the existing internal/external link components and remain keyboard accessible.

#### Scenario: Footer contents

- **WHEN** any page renders
- **THEN** the footer shows the mascot, the blurb, the link columns including social and RSS, and the sign-off

#### Scenario: Footer responsive stacking

- **WHEN** the viewport is phone-width
- **THEN** the footer columns stack vertically and remain readable

### Requirement: Chrome preserves existing navigation contract

The redesigned header and footer SHALL preserve existing destinations and link semantics: navigation to home, the blog/writing index, and about; the RSS feed link; and stable `/blog/<slug>/` article URLs.

#### Scenario: Existing destinations intact

- **WHEN** a reader uses the header or footer links
- **THEN** they reach the same destinations as before (home, writing index, about, RSS), with no broken or changed permalinks
