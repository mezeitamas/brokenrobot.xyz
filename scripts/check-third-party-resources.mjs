// Fails when built output requests a resource from a third party, so a page that the site's own
// CSP would block is caught before it reaches production rather than after.
//
// The site serves `default-src 'none'` with every fetch directive at `'self'` or `'none'`, so a
// third-party resource in the output is a silently broken page, not a style preference. Runs
// locally as `npm run thirdparty:check` and in CI's Test job against the `dist/` that Build
// produced.
//
//   node scripts/check-third-party-resources.mjs [dist/]
//
// Exit codes:
//   0 — pass: no third-party resource request found.
//   1 — FAIL: at least one found; each is printed as `path` then the offending URL.
//   2 — not verified: the directory is missing or holds nothing to scan, so the run proves
//       nothing. A failed `astro build` leaves `dist/` emptied or half-written and lands here,
//       which keeps an empty result from being reported as a pass.
