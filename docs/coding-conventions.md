# Coding conventions

The rules below are enforced by tooling (`.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc.json`,
`tsconfig.json`). They are documented here so the overhaul stays consistent. Run
`npm run format:check`, `npm run lint:check`, and `npm run type:check` before committing.

## TypeScript

Extends `astro/tsconfigs/strictest`. Notable, ESLint-enforced rules:

- **No `any`** (`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`).
- **Strict boolean expressions** — no implicit truthiness on strings, numbers, or
  nullables; compare explicitly.
- **Type-only imports** — use `import type { ... }` (`consistent-type-imports`).
- Prefer **optional chaining**; avoid confusing/unsafe non-null assertions.
- **No unused vars.** `verbatimModuleSyntax` and strict null checks are on.

## Imports

Enforced order (`eslint-plugin-import`): builtin → external → internal → parent → sibling →
index, with `exports-last`. Prefer the path aliases (`@components`, `@layouts`, `@assets`,
`@styles`) over deep relative paths.

## Formatting (Prettier)

- Print width **120**.
- **Single quotes**, **no trailing commas**.
- **One attribute per line** (`singleAttributePerLine`) — applies to Astro markup.
- Tailwind classes auto-sorted (`prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`).
- Covers `.astro, .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx, .cjs, .mjs, .css, .json, .md, .mdx, .yml`.

## Naming

- **Components:** PascalCase `.astro` files.
- **Utilities & non-component files:** camelCase or kebab-case as in the existing tree.
- **Feature folders:** kebab-case (`blog-posts/`, `meta-og/`, `rich-results/`).

## Astro component patterns

- Type props with a local `type Props = { ... }`; destructure from `Astro.props`.
- **Scoped `<style>` blocks** with `@reference '../../styles/base.css';` then `@apply`
  Tailwind utilities — match the existing `Header.astro` pattern.
- Use **named slots** for content/SEO injection (e.g. `<slot name="content" />`).
- Prefer the existing `InternalLink` / `ExternalLink` components over raw anchors.

## Client-side interactivity

Pick the lightest tool for the job:

- **Stateful UI → Preact island.** For widgets with real state (search, mobile menu,
  code-copy), write a Preact component (`.tsx`) and mount it `client:*`. Keep islands small and
  few — each ships the Preact runtime. `.tsx` follows the same strict rules as `.ts` (plus
  jsx-a11y), is covered by `lint`/`format`/`type:check`, uses Preact JSX
  (`jsxImportSource: preact`) and the idiomatic `class` attribute, and styles via token
  utilities (`bg-surface`, `text-text`, `border-border`).
- **Simple DOM wiring → bundled Astro `<script>`.** For small behavior, put the logic in a
  `.ts` module and `import` it from the component's `<script>` (e.g. `theme-toggle.ts` from
  `ThemeToggle.astro`). It bundles and loads from `self` (CSP-safe). Avoid logic that depends
  on initial state the server can't know — drive that from CSS on `html[data-theme]` instead,
  so there's no flash (that's why the toggle isn't an island).
- **Pre-paint only → one inline script.** The single exception is the theme-init script in
  `BaseLayout` (`set:html`), which must run before paint.
- **ESLint note:** `<script>` blocks are linted as virtual `*.astro/*.ts` files via a dedicated
  override in `.eslintrc.json`; keep that override so modern syntax in component scripts parses.

## Styling

- **Tailwind-first.** Reach for utilities before custom CSS.
- **Design tokens via CSS custom properties** in `src/styles/base.css` (see
  [architecture](architecture.md)). Theme-aware components read tokens, not hard-coded
  colors — this is what makes light/dark work.
- Article body uses the `@tailwindcss/typography` `prose` classes; tune `prose` to the
  tokens so long-form content respects the active theme.

## Testing

- **Playwright** E2E specs live in `tests/` (desktop Chrome + mobile Pixel 7 projects).
- **Visual regression** via screenshot snapshots (tight pixel tolerance). When intentional
  visual changes land, update with `npm run test:e2e:update` and review the diffs.
- **Accessibility** checks via `@axe-core/playwright` — keep them green.
- **Theme coverage:** because light and dark are both first-class, new UI needs snapshot /
  a11y coverage in **both** themes.

## Working principles

Follow the principles in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md), which govern how changes are made here:

- **Simplicity First** — minimum code that solves the problem; nothing speculative.
- **Surgical Changes** — touch only what the task requires; match existing style.
- **Goal-Driven Execution** — define verifiable success criteria and loop until they pass.
