description: Runs the brokenrobot.xyz quality gate — type-check, lint, format-check, spec validation, DESIGN lint, design-token drift, build, the third-party-resource guardrail, the Markdown-twin audit, and the Terraform check — and summarizes failures. Use before committing a change or handing it to review; the same set CI's Pipeline jobs enforce. This is the non-visual half of Verify; pair it with testing-visual-regression.
compatibility: Requires Node and npm at the package.json engine versions, with dependencies installed. `terraform:check` additionally needs Terraform on PATH (the devcontainer pins 1.15.8 to match CI) and `infra/cloudflare` already initialized.

Run the gate from the repo root. The commands are listed under **The preflight gate** in [docs/development/checks.md](../../../docs/development/checks.md), which is the only place they are listed. Read that section first, then run every command in the order it gives. Run them all even when one fails — stopping at the first failure hides the rest.

Report each check as pass/fail from its own exit status. For a failing check, quote its first error, as `file:line` + message where the check reports one. A check that never ran is `not run`, not pass. Open with the overall verdict: red when any check failed or is `not run`. Report failures — do not fix anything; the caller reviews and fixes.

Some checks fail for reasons that are not the caller's code — Terraform missing from PATH, an uninitialized `infra/cloudflare`, a `thirdparty:check` that found no `dist/`. checks.md documents these against each check and says which are `not run` rather than `FAIL`. Read a failing check's section there before you judge its exit status. One fix the caller must run is `terraform -chdir=infra/cloudflare init -backend=false`: it needs network access to the Terraform registry, so it will not work from a sandboxed shell.

Where a check's section says what it does not cover, carry that into the report. `terraform:check` is the one that misleads most: it runs no plan, so a change that is valid and wrong still passes it.

For example:

```
red — 2 checks failed

type:check       pass
lint:check       FAIL — src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx:18 — no-floating-promises (3 errors)
designmd:check   pass — 0 errors (2 warnings, advisory)
tokens:check     FAIL — src/styles/tokens.generated.css is stale; run `npm run tokens:generate`
terraform:check  pass — fmt + validate clean (no plan; apply is Terraform Cloud's)
```

The example is abridged to show the shape of a row. A real report has one row per check, in the order checks.md lists them.

This gate covers no visual regression or accessibility — a change is not verified until `testing-visual-regression` has also run.
